🔐 Excited to share my latest project: CloudGuardStack - A Multi-Cloud Security Analysis Tool! 

🎯 As cloud security becomes increasingly critical, I developed this tool to help organizations:
• Identify IAM security risks
• Detect exposed storage resources
• Find sensitive data exposures
• Generate actionable remediation plans

🛠 Tech Stack:
• Python (Pandas, Plotly, Seaborn)
• Jupyter Notebooks
• Multi-cloud architecture (AWS, Azure, GCP)

📊 Key Features Demonstrated in the Video:
1. Automated security scanning
2. Risk score visualization
3. Critical finding detection
4. Remediation planning

🎥 Check out the demo video to see the tool in action! I've demonstrated:
• IAM risk analysis
• Storage security assessment
• Real-time visualization
• Automated remediation suggestions

💡 Key Learning Points:
• Importance of least privilege
• Critical nature of storage security
• Value of automated analysis
• Power of visual security insights

🚀 While this demo uses simulated data, the tool is designed for real cloud environments. It showcases how we can automate security analysis and provide actionable insights for cloud security teams.
